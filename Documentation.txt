IoT-Enabled Smart Home Automation System - To-Do List and Achievements Tracker
================================================================================

Achievements: What I've Done
----------------------------
- Hardware:
  - ESP32: Set up as main microcontroller.
  - DHT22: Connected to GPIO 23 for temp/humidity data.
- Software:
  - WiFi Task: Connects to "Wokwi-GUEST", handles reconnection with event handlers.
  - ThingsBoard Task: Publishes DHT22 data to app.coreiot.io via MQTT, uses ThingsBoard SDK (C++).
  - DHT22 Task: Reads sensor data every 5 seconds, formats as JSON with ArduinoJson.
  - Switched to C++: Resolved ArduinoJson error by using .cpp files for ThingsBoard SDK.
- Protocols: WiFi, MQTT for IoT communication.
- Simulation: Wokwi with ESP32, DHT22, tested reconnection by toggling SSID.
- Documentation: GitHub README with WiFi/MQTT setup, renamed mqtt_task to thingsboard_task.
